    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that combines information retrieval with generative models. It enhances the performance of language models by incorporating external knowledge, which improves accuracy and factual correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Simple RAG setup, we follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Ingestion**: Load and preprocess the text data.\n",
    "2. **Chunking**: Break the data into smaller chunks to improve retrieval performance.\n",
    "3. **Embedding Creation**: Convert the text chunks into numerical representations using an embedding model.\n",
    "4. **Semantic Search**: Retrieve relevant chunks based on a user query.\n",
    "5. **Response Generation**: Use a language model to generate a response based on retrieved text.\n",
