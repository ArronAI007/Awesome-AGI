    "1. **Data Ingestion**: Extract text from a PDF file.\n",
    "2. **Chunking**: Split the text into manageable chunks.\n",
    "3. **Question Generation**: Generate relevant questions for each chunk.\n",
    "4. **Embedding Creation**: Create embeddings for both chunks and generated questions.\n",
    "5. **Vector Store Creation**: Build a simple vector store using NumPy.\n",
    "6. **Semantic Search**: Retrieve relevant chunks and questions for user queries.\n",
    "7. **Response Generation**: Generate answers based on retrieved content.\n",
