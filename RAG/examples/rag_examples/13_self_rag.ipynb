    "# Self-RAG: A Dynamic Approach to RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I implement Self-RAG, an advanced RAG system that dynamically decides when and how to use retrieved information. Unlike traditional RAG approaches, Self-RAG introduces reflection points throughout the retrieval and generation process, resulting in higher quality and more reliable responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components of Self-RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval Decision**: Determines if retrieval is even necessary for a given query\n",
    "2. **Document Retrieval**: Fetches potentially relevant documents when needed  \n",
    "3. **Relevance Evaluation**: Assesses how relevant each retrieved document is\n",
    "4. **Response Generation**: Creates responses based on relevant contexts\n",
    "5. **Support Assessment**: Evaluates if responses are properly grounded in the context\n",
    "6. **Utility Evaluation**: Rates the overall usefulness of generated responses"

      "Based on the comparison results from 1 test query, here's an overall analysis of Self-RAG versus Traditional RAG:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. When Self-RAG performs better and why:**\n",
      "In this query, Self-RAG performed better because it was able to retrieve all 3 relevant documents, indicating that it was able to effectively identify and retrieve the most relevant information related to the query. This suggests that Self-RAG's ability to dynamically adjust its retrieval decisions based on the query and the available documents may have contributed to its better performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. When Traditional RAG performs better and why:**\n",
      "There is no information provided in this query to indicate when Traditional RAG performed better. However, it's possible that Traditional RAG may perform better in scenarios where the query is very specific and the relevant documents are easily identifiable, and the system can rely on pre-defined rules and thresholds to retrieve the relevant documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. The impact of dynamic retrieval decisions in Self-RAG:**\n",
      "The dynamic retrieval decisions in Self-RAG appear to have a positive impact in this query, as it was able to retrieve all 3 relevant documents. This suggests that Self-RAG's ability to adapt to the query and the available documents may be beneficial in scenarios where the relevant information is not easily identifiable.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. The value of relevance and support evaluation in Self-RAG:**\n",
      "The relevance and support evaluation in Self-RAG seem to be effective in this query, as it was able to identify the 3 most relevant documents. This suggests that the evaluation metrics used in Self-RAG are able to accurately assess the relevance and support of the retrieved documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Overall recommendations on which approach to use for different types of queries:**\n",
      "Based on this single query, it appears that Self-RAG may be a better choice for queries where the relevant information is not easily identifiable, and the system needs to dynamically adjust its retrieval decisions to retrieve the most relevant documents. However, more testing and evaluation are needed to confirm this recommendation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, Self-RAG may be a better choice for:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Queries with ambiguous or open-ended questions\n",
      "* Queries with a large number of relevant documents\n",
      "* Queries where the relevant information is not easily identifiable\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, Traditional RAG may be a better choice for:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Queries with very specific and well-defined questions\n",
      "* Queries with a small number of relevant documents\n",
      "* Queries where the relevant information is easily identifiable and the system can rely on pre-defined rules and thresholds to retrieve the relevant documents.\n",
