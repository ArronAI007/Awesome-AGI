    "# Fusion Retrieval: Combining Vector and Keyword Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I implement a fusion retrieval system that combines the strengths of semantic vector search with keyword-based BM25 retrieval. This approach improves retrieval quality by capturing both conceptual similarity and exact keyword matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Fusion Retrieval Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional RAG systems typically rely on vector search alone, but this has limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vector search excels at semantic similarity but may miss exact keyword matches\n",
    "- Keyword search is great for specific terms but lacks semantic understanding\n",
    "- Different queries perform better with different retrieval methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Fusion retrieval gives us the best of both worlds by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performing both vector-based and keyword-based retrieval\n",
    "- Normalizing the scores from each approach\n",
    "- Combining them with a weighted formula\n",
    "- Ranking documents based on the combined score"
