    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances AI responses by retrieving relevant knowledge from external sources. Traditional retrieval methods return isolated text chunks, which can lead to incomplete answers.\n",

    "- Data Ingestion: Extract text from a PDF.\n",
    "- Chunking with Overlapping Context: Split text into overlapping chunks to preserve context.\n",
    "- Embedding Creation: Convert text chunks into numerical representations.\n",
    "- Context-Aware Retrieval: Retrieve relevant chunks along with their neighbors for better completeness.\n",
    "- Response Generation: Use a language model to generate responses based on retrieved context.\n",
