      "Based on the analysis, we recommend using proposition-based retrieval when:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The query is well-defined and specific.\n",
      "* The system has access to a large corpus of well-structured and organized text data.\n",

      "We recommend using chunk-based retrieval when:\n",

      "* The query is open-ended or requires a more general understanding of a topic.\n",
      "* The system needs to retrieve a large amount of information to provide a comprehensive response.\n",

      "Ultimately, the choice between proposition-based retrieval and chunk-based retrieval will depend on the specific requirements of the query and the characteristics of the system. A hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both methods may also be worth exploring.\n"
